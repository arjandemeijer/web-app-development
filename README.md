# WebApp Development
Basic bootstrap for developing a web app with the power of Svelte and Vite.

# Degit
Copy this repository file structure to your local development environment.
`degit https://github.com/arjandemeijer/web-app-development.git`

# Aim of Repository
Svelte pages compile to own dedicated js and css files. Project files are generated to general `{theme}` files that are reused in the project.
```
# Project css
dist/assets/css/theme.css

# Project js
dist/assets/js/theme.js 

# Component 1
dist/assets/pages/css/app-component-1.css
dist/assets/pages/js/app-component-1.js

# Component 2
dist/assets/pages/css/app-component-2.css
dist/assets/pages/js/app-component-2.js
```
